I started trying to set up the Waveshare GP2Y1010AU0F and decided to document the process (since I will undoubtedly goof up and need to figure out what I did).

To start, I tried DLing the sketch provided by the manufacturer from https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/File:Dust-Sensor-code.7z. When I tried to unzip the Arduino file, it didn't work. 

So I went with the code posted here - https://forum.mysensors.org/topic/6391/the-dust-sensor-is-now-finally-working.

Next, I needed to wire up the sensor. Keep in mind that I have purchased Waveshare's version of the sensor, which includes the required electronic components. So the blogs that describe how to wire up the basic GP2Y1010AU0F (e.g., https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Interface-With-Optical-Dust-Sensor/) are not directly applicable to me.
