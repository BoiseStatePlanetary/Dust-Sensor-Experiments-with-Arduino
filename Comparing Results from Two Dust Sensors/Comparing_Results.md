Starting with required documentation - 
* For the PPD42NS, this website provides the manufacturer's information: http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Dust_Sensor/.
* For the GP2Y1010AU0F, my own website - https://github.com/BoiseStatePlanetary/Dust-Sensor-Experiments-with-Arduino/blob/master/Setting_Up_Waveshare_GP2Y1010AU0F/Setting_Up_Waveshare_GP2Y1010AU0F.md.

I've posted the combined code that reads signals from both.

Unfortunately, the calibration curves for the two sensors give measurements that are not directly comparable.
